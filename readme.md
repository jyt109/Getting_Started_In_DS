## Steps to get started with the Data Science Stack

The following step will get you started with the Data Science Tools.

<br>

1. **Get comfortable with the command line so you can view / create files in the terminal**

   - Assuming you are on Windows, I suggest installing Cygwin. But eventually you wanna be on a Mac/Linux

2. **Get comfortable with Python**

   - Do the CodeAcademy Python Track (Loops, Conditions, Data Types, File IO, Functions)

     [http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)

3. **Install Python 2.7 and run a script from terminal using Python**

   - Python Installation

     [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
   - Running a script

4. **Github for backing your work up and version control**

   - You never want to lose all your code if something happens to your laptop
   - Github is also good for pulling down other people's code and view it on your machine. For example to
     pull this repo to your machine, you will execute `git clone https://github.com/jyt109/Getting_Started_In_DS.git`
   - To install Git, see [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Try creating your own repo and start pushing code to github (Optional)

5. **Introduction to `ipython`, `numpy` and `scipy`**

   - These are the core libraries you will use with your first encounter with data science
   - Harvard has an amazing course for this. Start from the first lecture (bottom of the page of the link below)

     [http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/publicationListing.shtml](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/publicationListing.shtml)
   - Their Github page with code practice in IPython Notebooks (Under `Labs`). Use Git to clone the repo and do the labs and homework

   - More IPython Notebook Intro if you are still not sure what it is:

   - Eventually you will grow out of IPython Notebooks and write more scripts, but for now, Notebooks are good for learning
